I have provided the notebook because most of the plots in my analysis are interactive. To run the plots you must have the following libraries.

1. seaborn
2. plotly 
3. pandas
4. numpy


The Scrape ATP notebook inside the data/ folder contains the scripts that I used to scrape data the ATP website - https://www.atptour.com/en/
